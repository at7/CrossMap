Hi, 

No, of course it is, it can be done with a variety of command line tools, or tools specifically design for the purpose. It was only surprising to see Haplotype Caller fail with vcf lift-over-ed with CrossMap for contigs in vcf header not matching those in fasta, similar thing happens for tools like Manta (SV calling), or Sentieon TNScope. I just thought to recommend this to be automatically done by Crossmap to make further analysis easier, and remove one step for workflows which utilize CrossMap.

If this is something you are not planning to implement, no problem, it just came as an useful addition for your tool.
